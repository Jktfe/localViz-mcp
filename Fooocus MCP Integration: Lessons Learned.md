Fooocus MCP Integration: Lessons Learned

  Based on our troubleshooting attempts today, here's a comprehensive overview of what we learned and what to focus on
   for a successful implementation:

  Key Findings

  1. File Structure Differences:
    - Fooocus-API uses main.py rather than app.py as the entry point
    - The API endpoints may differ from initial assumptions
  2. Initialization Process:
    - The first run of Fooocus-API triggers numerous model downloads (~335MB+)
    - This initialization process can take significant time
  3. Configuration Issues:
    - We confirmed the paths are correct, but API connection still failed with 404 errors
    - The server appears to run but doesn't respond to our expected endpoints

  Implementation Plan for Tomorrow

  1. Fresh Start Approach:
    - Begin with clean, minimal changes to the original repositories
    - Focus on integrating with the API exactly as documented
  2. Proper API Testing:
    - Start by manually running Fooocus-API and verifying endpoints
    - Use example scripts from the Fooocus-API repository
    - Test with simple curl/HTTP requests before integration
  3. Step-by-Step Integration:
    - Implement a step-by-step approach, confirming each component works
    - Create a simple test script that uses direct API calls
    - Only then move to the MCP integration
  4. Documentation Updates:
    - Maintain clear documentation of the correct paths and endpoints
    - Document the initialization process and expected waiting time

  Technical Requirements Verified

  1. Directory Structure:
    - Fooocus located at: /Users/jamesking/CascadeProjects/Fooocus
    - Fooocus-API located at: /Users/jamesking/CascadeProjects/Fooocus-API
    - Output path set to: /Users/jamesking/New Model Dropbox/James King/Air - JK Work/imageGens
  2. API Specifics:
    - Entry point: main.py (not app.py)
    - Default port: 8888
    - API endpoint pattern: /v1/generation/text-to-image

  Next Steps

  1. Start fresh with the API setup
  2. Allow full initialization to complete
  3. Test API endpoints directly
  4. Implement the MCP interface once the API functionality is confirmed
  5. Create a simplified testing process
